# vue-cli-plugin vue-types (WIP)

A plugin for [@vue/cli](https://cli.vuejs.org) to install [vue-types](https://github.com/dwightjack/vue-types).

If [@vue/cli-plugin-eslint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vue/cli-plugin-eslint) is installed, [eslint-plugin-vue-types](https://github.com/dwightjack/eslint-plugin-vue-types) will be installed and configured as well.

## Requirements

- Node.js >= 8.9.0 (we strongly suggest to use something like [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm))
- [@vue/cli](https://cli.vuejs.org) 3+

## Installation

```
vue add vue-types
```
